## 📂 Projects

1. **Biological Black Hole Adaptation 🌌**  
   A speculative research + simulation project exploring how organisms like tardigrades and plants survive or resist gravity — and how those strategies could inspire adaptation models for surviving near black holes.

2. **Smart Investment Tracker 📈**  
   A Python-based system using the Yahoo Finance API to track investments and visualize market data.

3. **FlexJob**  
   An online booking and management platform for service providers to streamline their scheduling and client management.

4. **Weather Telegram Bot 🌦️**  
   A Telegram bot that delivers daily weather updates and clothing recommendations based on conditions.

## 🤓 Fun Facts

📖 I write philosophical poetry and abstract ideas in my spare time.  
🧠 I’m obsessed with learning — I explore something new every day.  
🌌 I'm currently researching how biological systems respond to gravity.  
For example, I studied **how plants grow upward (defying gravity)** and how **tardigrades survive extreme gravitational forces** — then modeled those behaviors using Python and simulations to ask:  
> *Could these principles help us understand how life might adapt to survive near black holes?*

This idea became the basis for my [**Biological Black Hole Adaptation** project](https://github.com/MichalisIosif/biological-blackhole-adaptation), which blends biology, physics, and computational modeling.
